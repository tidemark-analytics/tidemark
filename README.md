Simple, privacy-first web analytics that runs on **ordinary PHP shared hosting**. One light dashboard in the spirit of
[Plausible](https://plausible.io), built with Laravel — upload a zip, open `/install`, done. No Node, no Docker, no SSH required.

- Cookie-free, no personal data: visitor ids are a salted hash that rotates every day, and IP addresses are never written to the database
- One page, everything on it: visitors, visits, pageviews, views per visit, bounce rate and visit duration, with sources, pages, locations, devices and goals underneath
- Plausible-compatible tracking script and Events API (`data-domain`, `window.plausible(...)`, `script.outbound-links.js`-style variants)
- Import your history from Plausible's CSV export
- Works on SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL
- Designed to scale out later: swappable event sink, separate analytics database connection, stateless app tier

## Don't want to run it yourself? Tidemark Cloud

The same open-source Tidemark, hosted for you at [tidemarkanalytics.com](https://www.tidemarkanalytics.com): no server, no updates, nothing to install. Sign up, paste one line into your site's `<head>`, and your dashboard is ready.

- **Free to start:** 1 site, 10,000 events a month and 6 months of history, with every report, filter, goal and shared link.
- **Pro, $7 a month ($70 a year):** unlimited sites, 250,000 events a month, 5 years of history, funnels, revenue, segments, journeys, rollups, alerts and webhooks, and your own logo and color on public dashboards. Need more events? Add packs of 250,000 for $5 whenever you like.
- **Still private by design:** no cookies and no stored IP addresses, and direct support from inside the app.
- **Switching?** Import your history from Plausible's CSV export.

Prefer to host it yourself? Everything below is for you, and it is free under the MIT license.

## Install on shared hosting (no SSH)

1. Download the latest `tidemark-x.y.z.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/tidemark-analytics/tidemark/releases/latest) (dependencies are bundled), or build it yourself: `scripts/build-release.sh 0.8.0` → `dist/tidemark-0.8.0.zip`.
2. Upload and unzip it on your host. **Point the domain's document root at the `public/` folder.**
   If your host won't let you, upload to the web root as-is — the bundled root `.htaccess` forwards to `public/` and blocks internals.
3. Visit `https://your-domain/install`: the page checks the server, connects your database (SQLite needs no setup), runs the migrations and creates your admin account.
4. Add a cron job (cPanel → *Cron Jobs*) — only needed for queue ingestion and data retention:

   ```
   * * * * * php /home/you/tidemark/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
5. Add a site and paste the snippet into your site's `<head>`. The dashboard waits for the first pageview and then opens by itself.

Requirements: PHP 8.3+, `mbstring`, `openssl`, `pdo` + one of `pdo_sqlite` / `pdo_mysql` / `pdo_pgsql`, `fileinfo`, `ctype`, `tokenizer`, `xml`.

## Install with Docker

A pre-built image for amd64 and arm64 is published to `ghcr.io/tidemark-analytics/tidemark`. With the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) in this repository:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

then open `http://localhost:8080/install` to create your admin account. Everything that changes lives in the `/data` volume (settings, the SQLite database, logs), the scheduler runs inside the container, and you update by pulling a newer image (`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`); migrations run on the first request. Set `PUID`/`PGID` to run as a different user (Unraid uses `99`/`100`). MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL work too: choose them in the installer and point them at your database container.

### Local development

```bash
composer install && cp .env.example .env && php artisan key:generate
touch database/database.sqlite && php artisan migrate
php artisan tidemark:demo        # fake traffic for demo.example.com; login demo@example.com / password
php artisan serve
php artisan test
```

## Updating

Sign in as an administrator, open **Account settings → Updates** and Tidemark shows when a newer release exists on GitHub; **Download and install** fetches it, checks its SHA-256 checksum and installs it. Tidemark looks for new releases daily, and every few hours while an administrator is using the app, and shows a dot by your profile when one is out; only the latest version number is requested. Set `TIDEMARK_UPDATE_CHECK=false` to turn that off, or `TIDEMARK_UPDATE_REPO` to follow a fork. You can also upload a release zip (`tidemark-x.y.z.zip`) yourself. Either way Tidemark validates the zip, backs up the current code to `storage/app/updates/backups/`, replaces the application files (never `.env`, `storage/` or your database), then runs the database migrations on the next request. The upload is sent in small pieces, so low PHP upload limits don't matter. It needs PHP's `zip` extension and a folder PHP can write to; otherwise upload the release over FTP as usual and visit the site once to run migrations. `scripts/build-release.sh <version>` stamps the version into the zip.

## Tracking

```html
<script defer data-domain="example.com" src="https://your-tidemark.example/js/script.js"></script>
```

Pageviews are sent on load and on every history change, so single-page apps work without extra code. Optional behavior is picked by
the file name — combine as many as you like (`script.outbound-links.file-downloads.js`):

| Variant | Adds |
|---|---|
| `outbound-links` | `Outbound Link: Click` events (`url` property) |
| `file-downloads` | `File Download` events (`url` property) |
| `form-submissions` | `Form: Submission` events |
| `engagement` | one `Engagement` event per page view with how far down the page the visitor scrolled and how long they were active ([details](#scroll-depth-and-time-on-page)) |
| `tagged-events` | click events from `class="plausible-event-name=Signup"` |
| `hash` | pageviews on `#hash` route changes |
| `manual` | no automatic pageviews; call `plausible('pageview')` yourself |
| `local` | also track `localhost` |

**Site settings → General** picks the right file name for you. Custom events and properties:

```js
plausible('Signup', { props: { plan: 'pro' }, callback: () => {} })
```

Create a matching **goal** (custom event or page) in the site's settings to see it under *Behaviors*. Use `data-api="https://…/api/event"` to send through a proxy on your own domain.
Anything that speaks Plausible's Events API works too: `POST /api/event` with `{"n": "pageview", "u": "https://example.com/", "d": "example.com", "r": null, "w": 1280, "p": {…}}`.

### Scroll depth and time on page

The `engagement` variant (**Site settings → Tracking → Scroll depth and time on page**, or add `.engagement` to the file name) answers "did they read it?" with numbers only: no element, text or position is ever captured. When a visitor leaves a page or switches tab, the script sends one **`Engagement`** event with two properties:

| Property | Values |
|---|---|
| `depth` | the furthest milestone reached: `0`, `25`, `50`, `75` or `100` (percent of the page). A page that fits on one screen is `100`. |
| `time` | active time on the page: `0-10s`, `10-30s`, `30-60s`, `1-3m` or `3m+` |

Add an **`Engagement`** goal (turning the setting on creates it), then open it under *Behaviors* to see how many visitors reached each depth and time, or filter any report by those properties, in goals and funnels too. Good to know:

- The event is **not an interaction**, so bounce rate and visit duration don't change, and it is stored as one row per page view however often the visitor comes and goes (the latest totals win). It does count as one extra event per page view.
- Active time stops after a minute without scrolling, moving the mouse, typing or touching the screen, and only counts while the tab is visible.
- Single-page apps are measured per route change. A measurement that arrives more than 30 minutes after the visit's last hit is dropped rather than starting a visit of its own.
- Send your own with `plausible('Name', { interactive: false })` or `"i": 0` in the Events API.

## What's included

- **Dashboard** — the six headline metrics with comparison (previous period or year over year), a graph with hour/day/week/month intervals, and a *view as table* twin.
- **Reports** — Sources (channels, sources, UTM campaigns), Pages (top, entry, exit), Locations (world map, countries, regions, cities), Devices (browsers, operating systems, device types), Behaviors (goals, custom properties). Every list has a *Details* view with search and paging.
- **Filters** — click any row, or use *Filter*: *is*, *is not*, *contains*, *does not contain*, wildcards (`/blog/*`), several values per filter. Filtering by a **goal** switches the dashboard into conversion mode.
- **Periods** — today, realtime, 24 hours, 7/28/30/91 days, month, 6/12 months, year, all time, custom; keyboard shortcuts for all of them (`D R W T Q M S L Y A C`, `X` compare, `F` filter, `←/→` step through days, months or years).
- **Sharing** — make a dashboard public, or create private shared links with an optional password.
- **Goals, shields, people** — conversion goals, block rules (IP, country, page, hostname allow-list), owner/admin/viewer roles per site, and teams: group people once and share a site with the whole team as viewers or admins.
- **CSV export**, a **Stats API**, API keys and two-factor sign-in.

## Brand

Logo (pictorial mark: pier pilings with a tide line across them), palette, typography, voice, naming rules and marketing copy are documented in `resources/brand/index.html` (open it through any static server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server` from the project root, then visit `/resources/brand/`). The logo set and contour motif are generated by `scripts/build-brand.py`; PNG/favicon exports by `scripts/export-brand-png.sh`. Source of truth for colors is `public/assets/app.css`.

## Interface notes

- **Layout:** a sidebar lists your sites and the sections of the open dashboard (Overview, Traffic, Audience, Conversions) and opens a ⌘K command palette; one dashboard per site at `/{domain}`. It opens with a plain-language summary and six KPI tiles, with a sticky toolbar for current visitors, *Filter*, the date picker and a ⋮ menu (interval, CSV export, settings). Narrow screens use a top bar instead of the sidebar.
- **Charts:** hairline grids, one tooltip with the comparison series, keyboard control (←/→) and a *View as table* twin. Refetching dims the previous render instead of flashing skeletons.
- **Colors:** deep-water neutrals with **Tide** teal as the interface color and **Buoy** amber as the signal. Chart series (`--series-1` Lagoon teal, `--series-2` amber) pass the palette validator on both themes — light `#0891a0`/`#d97706`, dark `#1fa3a8`/`#cf7f0c`. Re-validate if you change them.
- **Accessibility:** visible focus rings, focus-trapped dialogs, labeled controls, `prefers-reduced-motion` and forced-colors support, light/dark/system themes.
- **Fonts:** Inter is self-hosted (`public/assets/fonts`, SIL OFL) — no third-party requests.

## Configuration (`.env`)

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TIDEMARK_REGISTRATION` | `false` | Allow sign-ups |
| `TIDEMARK_INVITES` | `false` | Let site owners invite people who have no account by e-mail (needs working `MAIL_*` settings). Invitations expire after `TIDEMARK_INVITE_HOURS` (default 72) |
| `TIDEMARK_INGEST` | `sync` | `queue` buffers writes; drained by `schedule:run` or a worker |
| `TIDEMARK_ANALYTICS_DB` | *(app DB)* | Separate connection for `visits`, `events` and `event_props` |
| `TIDEMARK_IGNORE_IP`, `TIDEMARK_HOSTNAMES` | – | Comma-separated lists |
| `TIDEMARK_RETENTION_DAYS` | `0` | Delete raw data older than N days (daily via scheduler) |
| `TIDEMARK_GEOIP_DATABASE` | `storage/app/geo/GeoLite2-City.mmdb` | Needs `composer require geoip2/geoip2`; Cloudflare/Vercel/CloudFront geo headers work with no setup |
| `TIDEMARK_MAX_SITES` | `0` | Sites per user. `0` is unlimited |
| `TIDEMARK_UPDATER` | `true` | `false` hides Account settings → Updates and disables its endpoints |
| `TIDEMARK_TERMS_URL`, `TIDEMARK_PRIVACY_URL`, `TIDEMARK_REFUNDS_URL` | – | Links to your legal pages, shown on the sign-in and sign-up screens |
| `TIDEMARK_VERIFY_EMAIL` | `false` | New accounts must confirm their email before adding sites (needs `MAIL_*` settings) |

Behind a CDN (Cloudflare etc.) the real client IP and country are read from its headers automatically.

## Stats API

Create a key under **Account settings → API keys** and send it as `Authorization: Bearer …`. `site_id` is the site's domain; the query format follows Plausible's Stats API v1.

```
GET /api/v1/stats/realtime/visitors?site_id=example.com
GET /api/v1/stats/aggregate?site_id=example.com&period=30d&metrics=visitors,pageviews,bounce_rate
GET /api/v1/stats/timeseries?site_id=example.com&period=30d&metrics=visitors
GET /api/v1/stats/breakdown?site_id=example.com&period=30d&property=visit:source&limit=10
```

Filters use `filters=visit:country==DE;event:page==/blog/*`. The dashboard's own JSON endpoints live under `/api/sites/{domain}/stats/…`.

## Architecture

```
 browser ──► POST /api/event ──► Collector ──► EventSink ──► analytics DB (visits, events, event_props)
                                    │           ├─ DatabaseSink  (default: write in-request, stitches visits)
                                    │           └─ QueueSink     (buffer → worker → DatabaseSink)
 dashboard (Preact, no build) ──► JSON API ──► Stats engine (Period + Filters) ──► analytics DB
                                                └─ metadata DB (users, sites, goals, shared links, shields)
```

- **Visits, not sessions.** A visit is one row, stitched in the sink: hits from the same visitor within 30 minutes of inactivity extend it (entry/exit page, pageviews, bounce, duration). Reports read visits for most numbers and events for pageviews and goals.
- **Two logical databases.** Hot, append-only tables go through `TIDEMARK_ANALYTICS_DB`, everything else through the default connection. Tables are keyed by `site_id` and indexed on time, so they partition and shard naturally.
- **Stateless app tier.** Sessions and cache can move to Redis/DB; any number of PHP workers can serve requests.
- **Swappable seams.** `EventSink` (writes) and `Stats\Stats` (reads) are the only places that know about the storage engine — a ClickHouse implementation can replace them without touching controllers or the UI.
- **Privacy by construction.** Visitor ids are `hash(site, ip, user-agent, daily salt)`; raw IPs and user agents are never stored, and because the salt changes every day a visitor cannot be followed from one day to the next.

## Project name

**Tidemark** — a tidemark is the line a tide leaves behind on a shore or harbor wall: a record of how high the water reached, kept without keeping the water. That is the product's privacy model in one image: it keeps the aggregate line and never the footprints of individual visitors.

## Icons

Icons are [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) (ISC license), served from one self-hosted sprite at `public/assets/icons.svg` (only the icons in `scripts/icons.txt`). To add one: add its Lucide name to `scripts/icons.txt`, then `npm i --no-save lucide-static && node scripts/build-icons.mjs`. Use it with `<${Icon} name="chart-column" />`.
